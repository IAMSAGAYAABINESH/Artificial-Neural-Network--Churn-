# Artificial-Neural-Network-(Churn)

Here we will use artificial neural network classification to predict whether a customer will churn (exit the bank) based on the provided features:

Dataset : [Churn_Modelling.csv](https://github.com/IAMSAGAYAABINESH/Artificial-Neural-Network--Churn-/files/12319146/Churn_Modelling.csv)


1. **RowNumber**: An arbitrary identifier for each row in the dataset.
2. **CustomerId**: Unique identifier for each customer.
3. **Surname**: The customer's surname or last name.
4. **CreditScore**: The credit score of the customer, indicating their creditworthiness.
5. **Geography**: The geographical location or country where the customer resides (France, Spain, Germany).
6. **Gender**: The gender of the customer (Male or Female).
7. **Age**: The age of the customer.
8. **Tenure**: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
9. **Balance**: The account balance of the customer.
10. **NumOfProducts**: The number of bank products/services used by the customer.
11. **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
12. **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
13. **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated salary of the customer.
14. **Exited**: The target variable indicating whether the customer has exited the bank (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

The goal of using this dataset for artificial neural network classification could be to predict whether a customer will churn (exit the bank) based on the provided features. The features include both demographic and behavioral attributes of the customers, such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, and product usage, which may have an impact on the likelihood of churn. The dataset can be split into training and testing sets, and a neural network can be trained on this data to learn patterns that predict customer churn, which can be valuable for the bank's customer retention strategies.
